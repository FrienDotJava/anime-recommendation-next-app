# Anime Recommendation App (Next.js Frontend)

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Architecture)

This is a decoupled frontend application that works by communicating with a separate, deployed machine learning backend.

* **Frontend:** A **Next.js (React)** application that handles all user interaction and UI.
* **Backend (ML Model):** This app fetches recommendations by making API calls to a **FastAPI** server, which hosts the trained ML model. The backend is located in a separate repository and is deployed on Render.
* **Deployment:** The Next.js app is continuously deployed on **Vercel**.
